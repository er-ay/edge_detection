[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. Starting with 2011, OpenCV features GPU acceleration for real-time operations.
Officially launched in 1999 the OpenCV project was initially an Intel Research initiative to advance CPU-intensive applications, part of a series of projects including real-time ray tracing and 3D display walls. The main contributors to the project included a number of optimization experts in Intel Russia, as well as Intel's Performance Library Team.

### Edge Detection

I can describe this as: Methods to detect edges (where image brightness changes sharply) of given images/videos (includes real time videos from local camera).
I used Canny edge detection method -which is pretty easy to perform- in this repo.
